### Existing Source

Your NetBeans Project needs to have the following trees.

CakePHP 1.3.x

    myproject
    ├─nbproject
    ├─app
    ├─cake
    ├─plugins
    ├─vendors
    ├─...

CakePHP 2.x

    myproject
    ├─nbproject
    ├─app
    ├─lib
    │  └─Cake
    ├─plugins
    ├─vendors
    ├─...

NewProject (Ctrl + Shift + N) > PHP > PHP Application with Existing Source
Please select your cakephp dir(e.g. /home/NetBeansProjects/myproject)

### App Directory Name

Multiple app directory names support.

#### Change app directory name

Please set the following if you would like to different app directory name.

1. Project properties > Framework > CakePHP
2. `app Folder name` : please set your new app folder name

#### Use multiple app directories

If you use multiple app directories:

```
// CakePHP 1
cakephp1.3
├─app
├─app2
├─app3
├─myapp
├─...
├─cake
├─plugins
├─vendors
├─...

// CakePHP 2
cakephp2.x
├─app
├─app2
├─app3
├─mycustom
├─...
├─lib
│  └─Cake
├─plugins
├─vendors
├─...

```

Use **app** directory as NetBeans project e.g. app1, app2, myapp, e.t.c.:

```
myproject(e.g. myapp)
├── nbproject
├── Config
├── Console
├── Controller
├── Lib
├── Locale
├── Model
├── Plugin
├── Test
├── Vendor
├── View
├── index.php
├── tmp
└── webroot
```

1. Project properties > Framework > CakePHP
2. Check `Use the relative path to the CakePHP directory from the project directory.`
3. `CakePHP Directory` : "../"

Please notice that Code Completion is not available. You have to add the cakephp core path to include path.

After settings, please close your project and reopen it.

### Clear Cache Action

Delete each files of app/tmp/cache/* directorys.

### Install Plugins Action

### Code Completion

Support for core components and helpers (default).
Also support for classes in $uses, $components, $helpers.(also contain the alias)

```php
// e.g.
public $uses('Comment', 'Member', 'User');
// $this->Comm [Ctrl + Space] => $this->Comment [Ctrl + Space]

public $components('Search.Prg', 'Foo');
// $this->P [Ctrl + Space] => $this->Prg-> [Ctrl + Space] => display methods and fields

public $helpers('Session', 'Html' => array('className' => 'MyHtml'));
// $this->Html-> [Ctrl + Space] => display MyHtmlHelper class methods and fields
```

image file completion

```php
$this->Html->image('[Ctrl + Space]');
// popup file and directory names in the webroot/img
$this->Html->image('subdir/[Ctrl + Space]');
// popup file and directory names in the webroot/img/subdir
// ...
$this->Html->image('/mydir/[Ctrl + Space]');
// if you want to use files or directories in the webroot directory,
// please, start with "/"

$this->Html->image('Debug[Ctrl + Space]');
$this->Html->image('DebugKit.[Ctrl + Space]');
// support for Plugin images (CakePHP 2.x)
```
If target file exists, image will be displayed on document window.

You can run code completion also css and script methods (`$this->Html->css(), script()`) like the same as image method.
```php
$this->Html->css('[Ctrl + Space]');
// popup file and directory names in the webroot/css
$this->Html->script('subdir/[Ctrl + Space]');
// popup file and directory names in the webroot/js/subdir
$this->Html->css('/mydir/[Ctrl + Space]');
$this->Html->script('PluginName.[Ctrl + Space]');
```

element file completion

```php
$this->element('[Ctrl + Space]');
// popup file names in the appdir/View/Elements/
$this->element('MyPlugin.[Ctrl + Space]');
// support for Plugin elements (CakePHP 2.x)
```

### Go To View Action
You can move from controller action to view file.

1. Right-click at the controller action
2. Navigate > Go to view

e.g.

```php
class MainController extends AppController{
	// ... something
	public function index() {
		// Right-click or shortcut here
	}
}
```

If you use shortcut, register with Keymap.

When the view file doesn't exist, create the empty view file automatically if set as follows.

Check `Auto create a view file when go to view action is run`
at Right-click on project node > property > Framework > CakePHP

If you use the theme, set $theme to controller field.

### Go To Action Action

Similar to Go to view action.

1. Right-click on the view file (in editor)
2. Navigate > Go to action

### Smart Go To [v0.9.0]

You can go to specific files relate to a current file.
e.g. In case of current file is Controller, you can go to existing view, model, component, helper and test.

### Format+ Action (Format for CakePHP)

This action run the following.

1. Reformat (format settings : Tool > Option > Editor > Format)
2. Remove indents of Document Block
3. Change line separator to LF(Unix)

Q. Why do you add this action?

A. I add in order to follow the [CakePHP Coding Standars](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/contributing/cakephp-coding-conventions.html)

### Hyperlink for view element files (v0.6.9)

You can go to the element file from view file.

Search the following element file directories:

- app(app/View/Elements, app/views/elememts)
- core(lib/cake/View/Elements, cake/views/elements)

e.g.

```php
$this->element('sample');
```
Hold down Ctrl key and click on 'sample'.

If there is sample.ctp in the above directories, open the sample.ctp.
Otherwise do nothing.


### Display and Change debug level (v0.6.10)

You can change debug level on popup list.

When you choose the CakePHP file node, you would find the cake icon and debug level number at the lower right of the window.

If you change debug level, click the icon. Then the popup is displayed. Please, select the debug level number.

### Check Default Action (v0.6.15)

Check default asset names. (e.g. css/cake.generic.css, img/cake.icon.png, ...)

Check whether favicon.ico is changed.

### PHPUnit Test settings (PHPUnit Test Init Action)
**Support for only CakePHP2.x**

Project-right-click > CakePHP > PHPUnit Test Init

Do settings for doing PHPUnit Test with NetBeans.

Create following files:

- nbproject/NetBeansSuite.php
- nbproject/phpunit.bat or phpunit.sh
- app/webroot/bootstrap_phpunit.php

And set PHPUnit settings of Project properties:

- bootstrap
- custome script

If you run this action, you can test using fixture with NetBeans.

### Code Generation
#### How to run
`Alt` + `Insert` or Right-click on editor, select `Insert Code`.

#### Generate uses, helpers, components and actsAs fields
Dialog is displayed when you run Insert Code action.  
Please select what you want to use. And code like followings are inserted.

```php
$helpers = array('Html', ..., 'PluignName.SomeHelper');
$componens = array('Session', ..., 'MyComponent');
$uses = array('Post');
$actsAs = array('Tree', ..., 'PluignName.SomeBehavior');
```
You have to add settings for each classes by yourself if you need it.

#### Generate validations
This provides support for only **Core validations**.(e.g. notEmpty, isUnique, e.t.c)  
At first, you have to write the following before you run this feature.

```php
public $validate = array(
    'fieldName' => array(
        // please set caret to here
    ),
);
```

Please move caret to place which you want to insert, and run Insert Code action.
Then, code like followings will be inserted:

```php
// template
'validationName' => array(
    'rule' => 'validationName',
    'message' => 'validationNamemessage'
},
// template : has arguments(are not initialized)
'validationName' => array(
    'rule' => array('validationName', validationName_arg1, validationName_arg2),
    'message' => 'validationNamemessage'
},
```

Since message is focused, you can change it to your message.  
Please push `Enter` key after you change it. And you can move to next message.
If you want to move to previous message, please push `Shift` + `Tab`.

    // move the caret here
